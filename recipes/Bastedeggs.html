            <p class="description"> This recipe produces a delicious, simple egg with satisfying, set whites and a creamy, runny yolk. It's similar to a poached egg, but more flavorful and less fussy.</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Melt butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Carefully crack eggs into the skillet and let cook until whites have almost set, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Add water, cover skillet with a lid or cookie sheet, reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
                <li>Let cook until whites have set, yolks are still runny, and some of white has set over yolk, 1 to 2 more minutes. Remove lid and transfer eggs to a serving plate. Garnish with pepper and flaky salt, if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
